Description: Relatively easy access is provided to 2023 version of the Maddison 
      project data downloaded 2025-08-28. This project collates all the 
      credible data on population and GDP for 169 countries, with some dating 
      back to the year 1 of the current era. The 'MaddisonLeaders' function 
      makes it easy to find the leaders for each year, allowing users to 
      delete countries like OPEC with narrow economies to focus on technology 
      leaders. 'ggplotPath' makes it easy to plot data for only selected 
      countries or years. The 'MaddisonSources' function makes it relatively 
      easy to obtain references to the original sources, which must be cited 
      per the copyright rules of the Maddison Project for different uses of 
      their data.
