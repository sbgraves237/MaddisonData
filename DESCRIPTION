Description: Relatively easy access is provided to Maddison project data, which 
      collates all the credible data on population and GDP for 169 countries, 
      with some dating back to the year 1. 'MaddisonLeaders' makes it easy to 
      find the leaders for each year, allowing users to delete countries like 
      OPEC with narrow econmies to focus on the technology leaders. 
      'ggplotPath' makes it easy to plot data for only selected countries or 
      years.
